excerpt: 'Nanomaterials with unique edge sites have received increasing attention due to their superior performance in various applications. Herein, we employed an effective ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-assisted method to synthesize a series of exotic Bi2Se3 nanostructures with distinct edge sites. It was found that the products changed from smooth nanoplates to half-plate-containing and crown-like nanoplates upon increasing the molar ratio of EDTA to Bi3+. Mechanistic studies indicated that, when a dislocation source and relatively high supersaturation exist, the step edges in the initially formed seeds can serve as supporting sites for the growth of epilayers, leading to the formation of half-plate-containing nanoplates. In contrast, when the dislocation source and a suitably low supersaturation are simultaneously present in the system, the dislocation-driven growth mode dominates the process, in which the step edges form at the later stage of the growth responsible for the formation of crown-like nanoplates.'
